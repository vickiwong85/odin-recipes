    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Make these bite-sized victoria sponges for a special afternoon tea or birthday celebration. Choose your favourite jam for the filling, then add whipped cream.</p>
    <p>This recipe makes 12 sponge cakes.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>150g unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>150g golden caster sugar</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 tbsp milk</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>150g self-raising flour</li>
        <li>250ml double cream</li>
        <li>2 tbsp icing sugar, plus extra for dusting</li>
        <li>185g jam of your choice (strawberry or raspberry)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and line a 12-hole muffin tin with paper cases. Beat the butter and caster sugar together using an electric whisk until pale and fluffy, then whisk in the eggs, one at a time, scraping down the sides of the bowl after each addition.</li>
        <li>Add the milk, vanilla, flour and a pinch of salt, then beat again until smooth. Divide the batter evenly between the paper cases â€“ this can be easily done using an ice cream scoop. Bake for 17-20 mins, or until the sponges are golden, risen and a skewer inserted into the middles comes out clean. Leave to cool in the tin for 10 mins, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Once completely cool, the sponges can be frozen for up to three months.</li>
        <li>Remove the paper cases from the sponges, then split the sponges in half through the equator using a small serrated knife. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Whip the cream and icing sugar together to soft peaks using an electric whisk. Spread a little jam over the base of each sponge, then spoon or pipe over a dollop of whipped cream and sandwich with the tops of the sponges. Dust with a little icing sugar before serving. Best eaten on the same day.</li>
    </ol>
